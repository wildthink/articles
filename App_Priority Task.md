##### Overview

PT is a to-do, GTD, task management application. You can have multiple projects/task lists, ie.: Office/Work, Chores, Home Improvement, Reading List, Movie List, etc.

Each list can be reordered. The idea is that you work from the top to the bottom. There is no such thing as "important", etc. Only the thing you are currently working on.

"Leisure Mode" indicates you are deliberately not working on any tasks.

Each task has the following attributes:

- Action description
- Is it a Habit? - the point is to log regular progress
- Notes
- Dates (Ages)
  - Due Date
  - Date Created
  - Date First Started (it may be blocked)
  - Last Date of Progress
  - Last State Change Date
  - Completion Date
- Completion Time
  - Initial Estimate
  - Progress - Time, Duration, Date and Note - each time it is on the top of the list or logged
  - Ongoing Estimates (duration, date of estimate, and notes)
  - Actual
- Dependencies/Context
  - Project
  - Location (i.e. Grocery Store, Office)
  - People (e.g. a call or meeting)
  - Tools
  - Other resources
- Outcome - typically just "completed"
- State - planned, working, paused, blocked, awaiting response, complete
- Status - within ECT and on-time (or overdue)
