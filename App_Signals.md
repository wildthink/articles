## Signals - Application Design

Signals is messaging redesigned.

Within a group/room one can create an aside or private chat. Channels unique with regard to its member set. In other words, new messages to the exact same group of people will always appear in the same, single stream.

#### Aside

- Private between parties. NOT broadcast to entire group.
- Remains within the group chat timeline

#### Private Chat

- Private between parties.
- NOT shown within group chat
- Sent to the recipient in a 1-to-1 channel.
