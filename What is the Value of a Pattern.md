## What is the Value of a Pattern?

What makes a programming pattern valuable? We must first identify what we value in a system before we can we adopt a pattern!

<u>We must consider why engineering is often easier than reverse-engineering.</u>

What principles influence your perspective and decision?

[The power of good design Dieter Ramsâ€™s ideology](https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design)



Simplicity - Cognitive Load, not complected

Ease - Learnability, "near at hand"

? Declarative vs Functioal ?

``` swift
var x = 0
for i in 1...5 {
    x += i
}
// vs
sum (1...5)
// vs
sum (from:1, to: 5)
// vs
sum (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
// vs
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
// vs
(+ 1 2 3 4 5)
```





Parameter vs Constant (in Code) - When are parameters input? Compile, Build, Run, UX(interactive) time?

Property vs Class (OOP)

States vs Event - which is easier to test / reason about?

Mock Data vs Mock Objects/Classes

Given the same amount of code coverage, running 1 test with a 1000 different inputs is preferable to 1000 tests with 1 input each.
