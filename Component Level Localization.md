## Component Level Localization

Its been my experience that the localization process is rarely integrated into the development process in any way close to optimal. There are several things that contribute to this IMHO. Poor tooling, inadequate data formats, and decoupling the translation from the context of its presentation. It has only been recently that I discovered a project that points us in a new direction; we'll get to that in a few moments. But first let's take a brief look of the current state of affairs.
